# Head First Design Patterns
I'm going through the book and adding examples for said patterns.

1. Strategy Pattern - Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
2. Observer Pattern - Since we strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact, this pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes the state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
