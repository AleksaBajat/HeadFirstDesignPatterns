# Head First Design Patterns
I'm going through the book and adding examples for said patterns.

1. Strategy Pattern - Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
2. Observer Pattern - Since we strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact, this pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes the state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
3. Decorator Pattern - This allows us to attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators in its core make our code open for extension but closed for modification, which is very useful for extending functionality.
4. Factory Pattern - Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Practically speaking, it provides a certain class to relinquish its obligation to instantiate and delegate it to subclasses.
